<p>Why does the recipe say the prep time is 15 minutes, but it takes an hourÂ for you and the rest of usÂ mere mortals?</p>
<p>I used to think that cookbook writers were basically magical people, who, through enough training, could somehow cook faster than space and time would seem to allow. Maybe they can, but that&#8217;s not why prep times are so much shorter than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>It turns out, the prep time doesn&#8217;t even start until everything in the ingredient list is ready to go exactly as specified. Meaning that if the recipe says you need &#8220;a pound of frozen okra, thawed,&#8221; the time it takes you toÂ weigh it and thaw it doesn&#8217;t count toward prep time. Nor does prep time include the timeÂ it takes to wash, peel, chop, dice, or do whatever the ingredient list says.</p>
<p>Prep time also assumes that all the equipment you need is at hand and ready to go. Rummaging through cabinets, washing the whiskÂ you know you&#8217;ll need&#8211;none of that is covered.</p>
<p>Prep time is exactly the time it takes to follow the instructions, up until the actual cooking or baking of the food&#8211;no more, no less.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think most people know this. I only know it because I had to look up industry standards for recipe writing when I started this blog! Prep times areÂ writtenÂ this way because of tradition&#8211;in professional kitchens, prep cooks place ingredients out for the chef ahead of time. It makes sense for the home cook too when you think about it. If I have a food processor and you don&#8217;t, the time it will take us to chop our ingredients will be much different. If your kitchen equipment and pantry is organized and mine isn&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll find the items you need faster. So if prep time included these first steps, it might be unreliable much of the time.</p>
<p>Understanding prep timeÂ leads to another idea. It&#8217;s called mise en place, meaning to have everything ready before you start cooking. This way the prep time will be accurate. More importantly, you will stay calm and happy in the kitchen, and your food will probably improve because you&#8217;re not trying to multitask. If you start with your mise en place, for example, you won&#8217;t be trying to chop more vegetables while others are sauteing (and getting burnt if you stray for too long). You will also know ahead of time if you don&#8217;t have enough of a necessary ingredient, or if you have to do something rather time-consuming (e.g., thawing dough) ahead of time. These aren&#8217;t fun surprises after you&#8217;ve already started, and they take away from the joy of cooking.</p>
<p>Nowadays I always set up my mise en place before I start, even with my own recipes. First I read the recipe instructions. Next, I prep all the ingredients, and place them in clusters depending on when they&#8217;re used in the recipe. To save having to wash more dishes, I have shortcuts. I bought a ton ofÂ miniature cupcake papers dirt cheap, and measure my spices into one of them instead of a bowl (if the spices are added all at once). If the recipe has you add, for example, onion, celery, and carrots at once into the pot, I&#8217;ll chop them and put them in a single bowl. I also put all the equipment out, usually next to the ingredients they&#8217;re used for.</p>
<p>This makes cooking the pleasure it should be. I can focus on one thing at a time, and cooking becomes remarkably easy. If I do have down time&#8211;for example, I only have to stir something occasionally&#8211;I use it to clean up. Usually by the time dinner is ready, I&#8217;ve already cleaned up the kitchen, put on some nice music, had a bit of wine, and can dine in peace.</p>
<p>Give it a try! Â Stay happy in the kitchen. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Have you had any of these problems?</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming home to find you don&#8217;t have ingredientsÂ to make a quick, decent meal</li>
<li>RunningÂ to the grocery store at inconvenient times, or more often than you&#8217;d like</li>

<li>Miscommunications with people you live with about what you need from the store, whichÂ items need to be checked for vegan-friendliness, and what brand you prefer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a pretty simple system for my home that helps me avoid all these problems. Once you set it up, there&#8217;s very little effort to keep it going, and you&#8217;ll be amazed by howÂ smooth your home life becomes.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t my idea&#8211;maybe I found it on Lifehacker years ago?&#8211;but I&#8217;ve adapted it for vegans, whoÂ may need to shop at a couple different stores to find less common ingredients. For those of us livingÂ with non-vegans who sometimes do the shopping, I&#8217;ve adapted theÂ system to help those housematesÂ to find the right items and remember which to watch out for. For example, you won&#8217;t have to remind someone to check for lard on the refried bean label.</p>
<p>First, draw up a list of staples. These are the items you always want to have on hand. Here are some questions to help you figure out your staples:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the breakfasts, lunches, and dinners that you make most often? Â Write down the ingredients.</li>
<li>What are the quick meals you make when you&#8217;re in a rush or don&#8217;t feel like cooking? Write down those ingredients too.</li>
<li>What are the toiletries, health, and beauty items that will cause headaches if you run out?</li>
<li>If you bake, what doÂ you need to make bread, cookies, cakes, or whatever you&#8217;d likeÂ to be able to make on a whim?</li>
<li>If you have pets or children, what specialty items do they need?</li>
<li>What items do you need to clean your clothes and home, and handleÂ emergenciesÂ (e.g., stains, pet vomit, etc.)?</li>
<li>Think of the times you were most annoyed when you didn&#8217;t have something&#8211;what was it?</li>
<li>What do you run out of most often?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write all these items down!</p>
<p>Now start organizing these items. Put them into groupsÂ based on where they are located in yourÂ grocery store. Next, imagine the easiest route through the store&#8211;is it from front to back, left to right, etc.? Put the groups in that order.</p>
<p>Are there some items that you can only find at a certain store (not your regular store)? Highlight them. This way, you can plan out when you want to go to the less convenient store, and you can really makeÂ those trips count by stocking up on everything you can only get there.</p>
<p>Vegans, if you live with someone who does some of the shopping, starÂ each item that can be non-vegan (such asÂ refried beans, cleaning supplies, sugar, etc.). Think about how you want to communicate this to the person looking at the list. For some of my items, IÂ write &#8220;vegan&#8221; in front of each questionable item (example: &#8220;vegan refried beans&#8221;). For otherÂ items, I&#8217;mÂ more specific by specifying the brand or type that IÂ know is vegan-friendly. For example, instead of &#8220;vegan sugar,&#8221; you could writeÂ &#8220;Sugar in the Raw&#8221; or &#8220;organic sugar.&#8221; It depends on what your housemate already knows about veganism, orÂ what you think will be foolproof.</p>
<p>If you selectively buy organic, you canÂ also use yourÂ list as a way to help you or your housemates to remember which items you want to be organic. I always forget which fruits and vegetables are inÂ the &#8220;dirty dozen,&#8221; &#8220;clean fifteen,&#8221; etc. (these are lists of produce items that have more versus less pesticide residue). There&#8217;s also items like carrots that are so cheap, I feel like I may as well upgrade. By specifying when to buy organicÂ on the list, I don&#8217;t have to keep lookingÂ up information or thinking it through&#8211;I&#8217;m ready to go anytime.</p>
<p>You can writeÂ a list by hand and make photocopies of it, typeÂ this on the computer and make printouts, or keep a document on a mobile device&#8211;whatever will be easiest for you. Keep the list somewhere convenient for you and the people you live with. Whenever you or your housemates see an item that&#8217;s running low, circle it on the list. This will depend on how fast you use an item and how often you plan trips to the store. For example, let&#8217;s say your family goes through a roll of toilet paper a day. When you replace a roll of toilet paper, notice how many rolls are left.Â If you only want to go to the store once a week, circle toilet paper on the list when you&#8217;re down to sevenÂ back-up rolls.</p>
<p>If you need items that aren&#8217;t on the list (say you&#8217;re trying a new dish that week), just write them into the correct section and circle them too. All theÂ circled items <em>areÂ </em>your next grocery list, and you&#8217;ll be able to quickly make your way through the store toÂ find everything. You&#8217;ll always be able to whip up a meal at home, and you&#8217;ll never run out of toilet paper again. The image below is my personal list. You can also follow this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7aQaeKDwFrX8iOInL51UK1ANU8XO0qLQDPt9kZZGJI/pub">link toÂ my personal list</a>Â for a better view, so youÂ can customize it to fit your needs.</p>
<p>Good luck! And if you have another system that works for you, please leave a comment and tell us about it!</p>
