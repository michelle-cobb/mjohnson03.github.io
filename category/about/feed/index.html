<p><b>I createdÂ this blog to helpÂ people who:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grew up withÂ Southern or <a href="/about-the-pennsylvania-dutch/">Pennsylvania Dutch</a>Â food, became vegan, and are homesick for the comfort food they love.</strong> I was in your shoes when I <a href="/benefits-of-a-vegan-diet/" target="_blank">went vegan</a> in 2004! My blog will teach you how to reinterpret your favorites without meat, poultry, fish, dairy, egg, orÂ other animal products. Rivels and Grits is all aboutÂ recipes that you will enjoyÂ just as much as you did before, and oftenÂ even more! OccasionallyÂ I&#8217;ll also modernize recipesÂ that either aren&#8217;t very practicalÂ for today&#8217;s cooks, orÂ could use some extra pizzaz.</li>
<li><strong>WantÂ to explore regional vegan AmericanÂ cuisine.</strong> Â Pennsylvania Dutch cooking in particular has notÂ gotten much attention yet from vegan cookbooks and blogs. I&#8217;m excited to help change that.</li>
<li><strong>Are newly vegan and needÂ general information</strong> about vegan cooking and lifestyle. We&#8217;ll talk about issues like <a href="/egg-substitutes/">egg substitutes</a> (no worries&#8211;there&#8217;s a ton of them,Â and you can choose one that&#8217;s just right for what you&#8217;re cooking), findingÂ <a href="http://www.leapingbunny.org/indexcus.php" target="_blank">cruelty free beauty and housekeeping products</a>, and avoiding surprisingly non-vegan foods (<a title="Sugar: Why itâ€™s not always vegan, and what to do about it" href="/vegan-sugar/" target="_blank">like manyÂ refined sugars here in the U.S.</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Are vegan-curious.</strong> Maybe you&#8217;d like to know if you could go vegan and still enjoy allÂ the foodsÂ you love. The answer is yes! You can make vegan versions of everything fromÂ hollandaise sauce to marshmallow fluff to scrapple. Some of my recipes will taste a bit different from the originals, but I will never post anything that I believeÂ sacrifices any quality or tastes at all &#8220;fake.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Aren&#8217;t vegan, but wantÂ to reduce their consumption of animal products</strong> while still enjoying their American comfort foods.Â You&#8217;ve come to the right place!</li>
<li><strong>Have a special vegan in their life and want to cook for them.</strong> I like you already. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
