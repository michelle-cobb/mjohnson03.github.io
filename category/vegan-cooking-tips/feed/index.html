				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Baking Molasses Matchup</h2>
<p>The Pennsylvania Dutch sure do love their molasses, and I&#8217;m no exception! <a href="http://www.goldenbarrel.com/" target="_blank">Golden Barrel,</a> a Pennsylvania-based company, mailed me a free jar of their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097B663S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097B663S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=L24WFDHEXOZHBGJY" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Supreme Baking Molasses</a>. I decided to test it head-to-head with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VSY3UG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008VSY3UG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=ZV4GUWLTQBAD2PUT" target="_blank">Grandma&#8217;s Robust molasses</a>. Grandma&#8217;s Robust is the easiest baking molasses to find in grocery stores, at least here in Chicago.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Baking Molasses?</strong></h3>
<p>Molasses is typically made from sugar cane juice. The grades of molasses differ by the amount of sugar, if any, that has been removed from this juice. The sugar is removedÂ by boiling sugar cane juiceÂ three times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fancy molasses is the sweetest type, made from sugar cane juice that has had no sugar removed.</li>
<li>Table molasses (also called &#8220;light&#8221; or &#8220;Barbados&#8221; molasses) has had some sugar removedÂ byÂ the first boiling, but it&#8217;s still sweet enough to use on top of pancakes and toast.</li>
<li>Baking molasses has had more sugar removed, typically from the first and second boiling of the cane juice syrup.</li>
<li>Blackstrap molasses is the darkest and least sweet of all. It&#8217;s produced from the third boiling, and it&#8217;s somewhat bitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can remember baking molasses as the middle child, somewhere between table molasses and blackstrap molasses in sweetness. Grandma&#8217;s Robust is a blend of molasses from the first boiling. So you might expect it to be a table molasses, but its taste and color seem muchÂ more like baking molasses.</p>
<h3><strong>The Test</strong></h3>
<p>I made <a title="Vegan Shoofly Cake, Wet Bottom Style" href="/vegan-shoofly-cake-wet-bottom-style/" target="_blank">wet bottom shooflyÂ cake</a> twice during recipe development, once with Grandma&#8217;s and once with Golden Barrel. After the recipe was finalized I repeated the test, again with two shoofly cakes. A friendÂ tasted them all with me and gave his opinion as well. It was a big sacrifice for us to eat four cakes, but we persevered for the sake of theÂ blog. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Results: Texture</strong></h3>
<p>The cake with Grandma&#8217;s Robust was more dense and moist, and my friendÂ preferredÂ it that way.Â The cake with Golden Barrel&#8217;s baking molasses was a bit fluffier.Â I liked the fluffy version better, because I was making wet bottom shoofly cake. This meant that there was a molten layer of table molasses below the cake layer, and I liked having moreÂ contrast in texture between the gooey bottom layer and the fluffier cake layer. I might have preferredÂ Grandma&#8217;s Robust if I was making a <a title="Vegan Shoofly Pie (Molasses Pie)" href="/vegan-shoofly-pie/" target="_blank">wet bottom shoofly pie</a>, where I wantÂ a fudge-like, wetÂ texture throughout the molasses layer.</p>
<h3><strong>Results:Â Taste</strong></h3>
<p>I noticed a difference in taste, but my friendÂ did not. Although he loves shoofly cake and pie, he&#8217;s not Pennsylvania Dutch. Perhaps I&#8217;m genetically predisposed to detect nuances inÂ molasses! I don&#8217;t knowÂ how noticeable the difference in taste will be to other people, but here&#8217;s what I thought. The cake with Grandma&#8217;s Robust was slightly bitter, while the Golden Barrel molasses cake was sweeter and smoother. I didn&#8217;t expect that, becauseÂ Grandma&#8217;s Robust is made from the first boiling, and should be sweeter than Golden Barrel! They were both great cakes, but I preferredÂ the flavorÂ with Golden Barrel Supreme Baking Molasses.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>ForÂ fluffierÂ baked goods, use Golden Barrel baking molasses.</li>
<li>For more dense, moist baked goods, useÂ Grandma&#8217;s Robust.</li>
<li>If aÂ slightly sweeter, smoother flavor is most important to you, use Golden Barrel.
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re baking for someone who has never eatenÂ molasses-heavy desserts, I think the less bitter taste of Golden Barrel will help them ease into it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun Fact: Molasses is acidic, soÂ itÂ can activate the rising action of baking soda just like vinegar or lemon juice.</p>
<p>Happy baking!</p>

<p>Around 2008, I was giftedÂ a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QFL0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00005QFL0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=YB2RAF36XXJY5C25">Panasonic Automatic Bread Maker, model SD-YD250</a>. This machine still serves me well today. I love its convenience, as well as the smell of fresh-baked bread in the morning. There was one major problem at first, though. Almost every <a href="ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/kitchenappliance/sdyd250/sd-yd250_en_om.pdf">recipe included with the machine</a> called for dry milk powder. When I called customer service to ask for a non dairy substitute for milk powder in bread, they told me I was &#8220;stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news about this badÂ service: they were wrong! I&#8217;ve been adaptingÂ <a href="ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/kitchenappliance/sdyd250/sd-yd250_en_om.pdf">their recipes</a>Â for years sinceÂ I found a substitute, with beautiful results every time.</p>
<h2>A Non Dairy Substitute for Milk Powder in Bread:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ochef.com/1065.htm">One part powdered milk yields four parts liquid milk</a> when reconstituted with water. So you can use whatever non dairy liquid milk substitute you prefer (I use unsweetened soy milk)Â inÂ four times the amount of dry powder. Then reduce whatever water the recipe calls for by that amount.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the recipe calls for 1 Tbsp. dry milk powder. You canÂ substitute 4 Tbsp. (1/4 cup) soy milk, and reduce the water in the recipe by 1/4 cup.</p>
<p>Similarly,Â ifÂ the recipe calls for 1/4 cup milk powder, you can substitute 1 cup soy milk, and reduce the water in the recipe by 1 cup.</p>
<p>Why do bread machine recipes call for milk powder and water? Â Why not make it simplerÂ and just call for regular liquid milk? <a href="http://www.ochef.com/1065.htm">Â If it&#8217;s a bread machine with a delayed timer, milk may become unsafe if sitting at room temperature for hours during the delay</a>. Once opened, even shelf-stable soy milk needs to be refrigerated, so keep food safetyÂ in mind if you&#8217;re using a delayed timer.</p>
<p>Happy vegan baking!</p>

<p>Choosing egg substitutes for a recipe can seem hit or miss, because eggs can serve several different functions. Let&#8217;s take the guesswork out of it!</p>
<p>The trick is to figure out which purpose eggs&nbsp;are serving in the recipe that you want to veganize. Then you can choose egg substitutes that will do the same thing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll go through the steps to&nbsp;figure this out&nbsp;and&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;a few examples of egg substitutes that can serve the same purposes as eggs. In a couple of days, I&#8217;ll make a new post walking you through three examples from my own recipes, to&nbsp;show you how I choose egg substitutes in simple and complex situations.</p>
<p>Note that this post doesn&#8217;t apply to dishes where egg is the primary focus, such as meringue, quiche, or scrambled/fried/hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<h2>Part 1:&nbsp;What Purposes can Eggs Serve?</h2>
<p>Remember <strong>Mr. Betc </strong>(pronounce&nbsp;it&nbsp;&#8220;Mr. Betsy&#8221;). &nbsp;It&#8217;s not the coolest acronym,&nbsp;but it does help you remember the possible functions of eggs in a recipe. We&#8217;ll explain these purposes in Part 2, below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>oisture</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>ise</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>ind</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>mulsify</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>aste</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>olor</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: Figure Out the Purpose of Eggs in a&nbsp;Recipe</h2>
<p>How do you know which of these purposes eggs are serving in your recipe? Go through the following 5 steps in order.&nbsp;A few of these steps are from <a href="http://chefinyou.com/role-of-egg-baking-cooking" target="_blank">Chef In You&#8217;s great post on figuring&nbsp;out the purpose of eggs</a>, which helped me to&nbsp;be systematic instead of just relying on intuition when&nbsp;choosing egg substitutes.</p>
<ol>
<li>If there isn&#8217;t much other liquid in the recipe, the egg is being used to add <strong>moisture</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Tip: Egg whites dry out baked goods, so if egg whites but no yolks are used, the eggs are probably not being used to add moisture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are no&nbsp;other raising agents&nbsp;(e.g., baking powder, baking soda, baker&#8217;s yeast*) in the recipe, but the dish is supposed to rise (for example, it&#8217;s a cake but not a custard), then&nbsp;egg is being used to make the food <strong>rise</strong>.&nbsp;Eggs can do this when they&#8217;re beaten. This is called leavening.
<ul>
<li>Tip: Egg yolks are too fatty to make foods rise. If the recipe only calls for yolks and no whites, the egg is not being used for rise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the recipe&nbsp;has water-based liquids and a substantial amount of&nbsp;oil or butter (e.g., a salad dressing with oil and vinegar, a mayonnaise with oil and vinegar/lemon juice, a hollandaise sauce with butter/oil and lemon juice), the egg is being used as an <strong>emulsifier</strong>. Emulsifiers&nbsp;help oil/butter and water-based liquids to stay mixed instead of separating.
<ul>
<li>Tip: The emulsifier is actually the yolk of the egg. So if a recipe only calls for egg whites and no yolks, the egg is not being used as an emulsifier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If none of the first 3 cases applies (i.e., the egg is not being used for&nbsp;moisture, rise, or emulsifying), and there are no other binders&nbsp;(e.g., cornstarch, flour, breadcrumbs) in the recipe to hold the ingredients together, the egg&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to <strong>bind</strong>.</li>
<li>If none of the first 4 cases applies (i.e., the egg is not being used for moisture, rise, emulsifying, or binding), the egg is being used for <strong>taste</strong> and/or <strong>color</strong>.&nbsp;Eggs may also be adding taste or color if there are more eggs in the recipe than necessary&nbsp;to serve their main purpose (i.e., moisture, rise, bind, emulsify).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 3: Choose Egg Substitutes that&nbsp;Serve the Same Purpose</h2>
<p>There are so many egg substitutes out there! I&#8217;ve listed my favorite options for each function here. If you&#8217;re trying to replace 3&nbsp;or more eggs, don&#8217;t try to do that by just increasing the servings of&nbsp;the substitutes I&#8217;ve listed here. Post a comment with the recipe you&#8217;re trying to veganize, and I&#8217;ll be happy to let you know my thoughts. I recently&nbsp;replaced eggs successfully in a recipe that called for 2 yolks and 3 eggs, using a variety of substitutes with&nbsp;different functions! &nbsp;Such things are possible, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend trying to figure it out on your own&nbsp;when you&#8217;re just starting out.</p>
<ul>
<li>For&nbsp;<strong>moisture</strong>, replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup <a href="http://www.tofutti.com/dairy-free-cheeses/sour-cream/better-than-sour-cream/" target="_blank">vegan sour cream</a> per egg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For <strong>rise*</strong>, replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014DZGUQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0014DZGUQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=QL4KLUTPMZX25U5R" target="_blank">Ener-G Egg Replacer</a>&nbsp;OR</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. vinegar + 1 tsp. baking soda per egg&nbsp;(for browner baked goods) OR</li>
<li>2 Tbsp. water + 1 Tbsp. oil + 1&nbsp;tsp. baking powder, whisked together, per egg (for lighter, fluffier baked goods)</li>
<li>For more info, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/what-is-the-difference-between-baking-powder-and-baking-soda-in-pancakes.html" target="_blank">Serious Eats post about&nbsp;baking soda versus baking powder</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For&nbsp;<strong>binding</strong>, replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp. cornstarch +&nbsp;2 Tbsp. water (I omit the water if there&#8217;s a lot of other&nbsp;liquid in the recipe)&nbsp;per egg&nbsp;OR</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. soy flour mixed with 1 Tbsp. water, per egg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To <strong>emulsify</strong>, replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup pureed, soft Silken Tofu per egg. Tofu contains soy lecithin that can replace the emulsifying lecithin found in egg yolks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For&nbsp;<strong>taste,</strong>&nbsp;replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESNTYUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ESNTYUM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=3ZXTU42F7VVSAWOL" target="_blank">Vegg Vegan Egg Yolk</a>, which looks and smells just like egg yolk. Make sure you follow the package instructions and&nbsp;use a blender to mix the Vegg with water&#8211;hand mixing will&nbsp;not work!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For&nbsp;<strong>color</strong>, replace eggs with:
<ul>
<li>Turmeric OR</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESNTYUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ESNTYUM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=3ZXTU42F7VVSAWOL" target="_blank">Vegg Vegan Egg Yolk</a>&nbsp;(see above)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*You&#8217;ll see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast" target="_blank">nutritional yeast</a>&nbsp;in many vegan recipes. Don&#8217;t let the &#8216;yeast&#8217; in the name fool you&#8211;it is not active yeast, meaning that it is not a leavening agent&nbsp;and will not help baked goods&nbsp;rise!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear about&nbsp;your experiences using egg substitutes! &nbsp;Please post a comment or question below, and let&#8217;s get a discussion going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="boxer" href="http://i2.wp.com/rivelsandgrits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sugar2.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-113 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/rivelsandgrits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sugar2-e1413770113983.jpg?resize=160%2C196" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Is sugar vegan? Â Unfortunately, sugar in the U.S. is oftenÂ processed by using animal bone char as a filter. This filteringÂ makes sugar white by removing all traces of molasses.</p>
<p>This is also true for powdered (confectioners) sugar. It&#8217;s even true forÂ brown sugar, because brown sugar is made by combining molasses with refined white sugar.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many vegan sugars!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All USDA organic sugar</strong> is vegan (not processed using animal bone). There are also organic light brown, dark brown, and powdered sugars.</li>
<li><strong>Evaporated cane juice</strong> is also vegan. Just don&#8217;tÂ let the word &#8220;juice&#8221;Â fool you into thinking it&#8217;s a health food&#8211;it&#8217;sÂ sugar. Many organic sugars are evaporated cane juice.</li>
<li><strong>Raw sugar</strong>, such asÂ turbinado sugar, is another vegan alternative. Even though raw sugarÂ is a tan or light brown color (because not all the molasses has been removed), it is a substitute for white sugar, not brown sugar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many organic and raw sugars have larger grainsÂ than granulatedÂ (table) sugar. You probably wouldn&#8217;t want to use much ofÂ themÂ if you&#8217;re cooking something with a delicate or light texture. Thankfully, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086VWAYO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0086VWAYO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=MVRKQLJPXNAKCJGP">organic fine granulated sugar</a> exists! I also readÂ that <a href="http://bakingbites.com/2011/12/white-sugar-vs-raw-sugar-in-baking/">you can use a food processor to breakÂ rawÂ sugar grainsÂ down to the size of table sugar</a>, although I haven&#8217;t tried it yet. Will let you know when I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, the problem is only with cane sugar. <strong>Beet sugar</strong>, however, is never processed using animal bone. It&#8217;s hard to find, because beet sugar is often unlabeled or combined with cane sugar&#8211;but clearly labeledÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041TXHG0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0041TXHG0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=riveandgrit-20&amp;linkId=GO3R3KE2S77I5TC4">100% beet sugar does exist</a>. I found a GMO-free bag at Whole Foods. Some people don&#8217;t notice a difference when they use 100% beet sugar, but <a href="http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/can-use-beet-sugar-cooking-23658.html">others do</a>.</li>
</ul>
