		<description><![CDATA[Hi Belinda, I&#039;m so excited to hear from you! I&#039;d love to hear your feedback when you try any of the recipes, and please let me know if you have any favorite dishes that you&#039;d like to see veganized on this blog. The main reason I started this blog was to help people in your situation to recreate the wonderful food they grew up with. Thanks for your kind words!]]></description>
