		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] the crumbs with vegan margarine (vegetable shortening results in a bland taste). Finally, I used organic sugar, which is processed without use of animal bone char. Most organic sugars are raw and have coarse granules, and I think that&#8217;s a good thing here [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] My favorite milk pie recipe is from Betty Groff&#8217;s Pennsylvania Dutch Cookbook. I&#8217;ve tried replacing the milk with soy milk, but I found that almond milk has a better taste here. Plus, the brighter white color of almond milk looks great. I replaced the cream with full-fat coconut milk, specifically Trader Joe&#8217;s coconut cream; it&#8217;s the thickest I could find, and it&#8217;s really cheap in stores. If you&#8217;re not crazy for coconut, don&#8217;t worry&#8211;the finished pie won&#8217;t taste too much like coconut. Then I just substituted vegan margarine (Earth Balance) for butter and used organic sugar so that I know the sugar is vegan. [&#8230;]]]></description>
