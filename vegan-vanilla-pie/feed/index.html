		<description><![CDATA[Michelle was nice enough to bring me a sample of this pie and it was every bit as delicious as it looks.  Perfectly light and flavorful. I found myself wanting more.  I&#039;m not a fan of super sweet deserts so I was happy to find the molasses was not overpowering but instead really completes the flavor. On a side note,  I briefly heated it up in the microwave. This made it a warm, gooy piece pure heaven! I highly suggest having it this way.  I&#039;m looking forward to having this delicious treat again.]]></description>
